timer也叫定时器，ticker是反复触发的定时器。实际上 timer和ticker 的代码已经都不在time标准库里了，都在golang的runtime包里。

在Go 在1.14版本之后，timer源码实现上有了巨大变更，移除了timersBucket，所有的timer都以最小四叉堆的形式存储 P 中（Golang GPM调度模型中的P）。（最小四叉堆参考之前的最小二叉堆的源码分析，完全一样的逻辑）

```go
type p struct {
	id          int32
	status      uint32 // one of pidle/prunning/...
	link        puintptr
	schedtick   uint32     // incremented on every scheduler call
	syscalltick uint32     // incremented on every system call
	sysmontick  sysmontick // last tick observed by sysmon
	m           muintptr   // back-link to associated m (nil if idle)
	mcache      *mcache
	pcache      pageCache
	raceprocctx uintptr

	deferpool    []*_defer // pool of available defer structs (see panic.go)
	deferpoolbuf [32]*_defer

	// Cache of goroutine ids, amortizes accesses to runtime·sched.goidgen.
	goidcache    uint64
	goidcacheend uint64

	// Queue of runnable goroutines. Accessed without lock.
	runqhead uint32
	runqtail uint32
	runq     [256]guintptr
	// runnext, if non-nil, is a runnable G that was ready'd by
	// the current G and should be run next instead of what's in
	// runq if there's time remaining in the running G's time
	// slice. It will inherit the time left in the current time
	// slice. If a set of goroutines is locked in a
	// communicate-and-wait pattern, this schedules that set as a
	// unit and eliminates the (potentially large) scheduling
	// latency that otherwise arises from adding the ready'd
	// goroutines to the end of the run queue.
	//
	// Note that while other P's may atomically CAS this to zero,
	// only the owner P can CAS it to a valid G.
	runnext guintptr

	// Available G's (status == Gdead)
	gFree struct {
		gList
		n int32
	}

	sudogcache []*sudog
	sudogbuf   [128]*sudog

	// Cache of mspan objects from the heap.
	mspancache struct {
		// We need an explicit length here because this field is used
		// in allocation codepaths where write barriers are not allowed,
		// and eliminating the write barrier/keeping it eliminated from
		// slice updates is tricky, moreso than just managing the length
		// ourselves.
		len int
		buf [128]*mspan
	}

	tracebuf traceBufPtr

	// traceSweep indicates the sweep events should be traced.
	// This is used to defer the sweep start event until a span
	// has actually been swept.
	traceSweep bool
	// traceSwept and traceReclaimed track the number of bytes
	// swept and reclaimed by sweeping in the current sweep loop.
	traceSwept, traceReclaimed uintptr

	palloc persistentAlloc // per-P to avoid mutex

	_ uint32 // Alignment for atomic fields below

	// The when field of the first entry on the timer heap.
	// This is updated using atomic functions.
	// This is 0 if the timer heap is empty.
	timer0When uint64

	// The earliest known nextwhen field of a timer with
	// timerModifiedEarlier status. Because the timer may have been
	// modified again, there need not be any timer with this value.
	// This is updated using atomic functions.
	// This is 0 if there are no timerModifiedEarlier timers.
	timerModifiedEarliest uint64

	// Per-P GC state
	gcAssistTime         int64 // Nanoseconds in assistAlloc
	gcFractionalMarkTime int64 // Nanoseconds in fractional mark worker (atomic)

	// limiterEvent tracks events for the GC CPU limiter.
	limiterEvent limiterEvent

	// gcMarkWorkerMode is the mode for the next mark worker to run in.
	// That is, this is used to communicate with the worker goroutine
	// selected for immediate execution by
	// gcController.findRunnableGCWorker. When scheduling other goroutines,
	// this field must be set to gcMarkWorkerNotWorker.
	gcMarkWorkerMode gcMarkWorkerMode
	// gcMarkWorkerStartTime is the nanotime() at which the most recent
	// mark worker started.
	gcMarkWorkerStartTime int64

	// gcw is this P's GC work buffer cache. The work buffer is
	// filled by write barriers, drained by mutator assists, and
	// disposed on certain GC state transitions.
	gcw gcWork

	// wbBuf is this P's GC write barrier buffer.
	//
	// TODO: Consider caching this in the running G.
	wbBuf wbBuf

	runSafePointFn uint32 // if 1, run sched.safePointFn at next safe point

	// statsSeq is a counter indicating whether this P is currently
	// writing any stats. Its value is even when not, odd when it is.
	statsSeq uint32

	// Lock for timers. We normally access the timers while running
	// on this P, but the scheduler can also do it from a different P.
	timersLock mutex

	// Actions to take at some time. This is used to implement the
	// standard library's time package.
	// Must hold timersLock to access.
	timers []*timer

	// Number of timers in P's heap.
	// Modified using atomic instructions.
	numTimers uint32

	// Number of timerDeleted timers in P's heap.
	// Modified using atomic instructions.
	deletedTimers uint32

	// Race context used while executing timer functions.
	timerRaceCtx uintptr

	// maxStackScanDelta accumulates the amount of stack space held by
	// live goroutines (i.e. those eligible for stack scanning).
	// Flushed to gcController.maxStackScan once maxStackScanSlack
	// or -maxStackScanSlack is reached.
	maxStackScanDelta int64

	// gc-time statistics about current goroutines
	// Note that this differs from maxStackScan in that this
	// accumulates the actual stack observed to be used at GC time (hi - sp),
	// not an instantaneous measure of the total stack size that might need
	// to be scanned (hi - lo).
	scannedStackSize uint64 // stack size of goroutines scanned by this P
	scannedStacks    uint64 // number of goroutines scanned by this P

	// preempt is set to indicate that this P should be enter the
	// scheduler ASAP (regardless of what G is running on it).
	preempt bool

	// Padding is no longer needed. False sharing is now not a worry because p is large enough
	// that its size class is an integer multiple of the cache line size (for any of our architectures).
}
